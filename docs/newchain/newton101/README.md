- In order to better integrate NewIoT technology, modify the signature algorithm from secp256-k1 to secp256-r1
- In order to support higher GasPrice settings, modify some of the limiting parameters, including maxPrice and SuggestPrice
- The consensus algorithm uses PoA, and the block interval is 3 seconds
